To-Do List Application


This project is a simple To-Do List web application built using Express.js, EJS for templating, SQLite for database storage, and HTML/CSS for the front-end. Users can create and manage to-do items, which are stored persistently in an SQL database.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to either the default list (daily tasks) or a separate "Work List".
View Tasks: All tasks are retrieved from the SQL database and displayed on the homepage (or work list).
Delete Tasks: Tasks can be marked as completed and deleted by clicking the checkbox next to the task.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in an SQLite database, ensuring that data remains available after server restarts.
